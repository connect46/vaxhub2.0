Vax supply chain planning

To-dos
For demo
[] Inventory planning - Demand: The monthly Demand will be calculated using the Forecasted Procurement (not the Constrained Procurement) from the  Financial Plan's final table, spread evenly over 12 months. Stuck on this after multiple attempts.
[] Inventory planning - use Proposed Procurement numbers from financial-planning to calculate recommended planned shipments (evenly distributed).
[] Inventory planning - In table under Planned shipments column (show sum of proposed shipments vs. target = proposed procurement number) i.e. a Budget Check: The "Gap" row will compare your total planned shipments against the Proposed Procurement budget from the Financial Plan.
[x] Inventory planning - make sure data entry *over-rides* recommended amounts.
[x] Financial planning - make sure numbers add up. Re-label and update as needed.
